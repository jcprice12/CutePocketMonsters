To reset the db and populate it, do the following:

### MAKE SURE YOUR CONFIG FILE MATCHES YOUR LOCAL CONFIGURATION

1.) run the schema file that can find in this directory (this will drop the database and make it again)
2.) run "node server.js" while in the root folder of the project (this will sync the database with the models defined in the models/ folder)
3.) run "sequelize db:seed:all" while in the root directory of the project to run the seed scripts inside the seeders/ folder
    NOTE: you will need to have the mysql2 package installed globally for this command to work. To install it globally, do "npm install mysql2 -g" in your bash terminal
    (this command can be executed while you are in any directory).
    NOTE: To undo the seeding, run "sequelize:seed:undo:all" while in the root directory of the project
